In POWHEG there is a mechanism to identify equivalent amplitudes (for example, differing only by irrelevant flavour labels).
Normally, when the program starts, powheg checks if a group of amplitudes are equal or proportional, by comparing
thier values on 10 randomly chosen momentum assignments.

Starting with version 3776 some options have been added in order to fix the equivalent amplitudes information at
compile time. The tolerance parameter to determine if two amplitudes are related, after version 3776, can
be overridden by the use by adding the line

compare_vecsr_ep <value>   ! the default is 1d-8. This is the tolerance parameter for the real amplitudes.
compare_vecsb_ep <value>   ! the default is 1d-12. This is the tolerance parameter for the born amplitudes.
compare_vecsv_ep <value>   ! the default is 1d-8. This is the tolerance parameter for the virtual amplitudes.

In order to hardcode the equivalence relations in the program, A
developer of a POWHEG-BOX implementation can start its program adding
in the powheg.input file the line

writeequivfile 1

After the program has invoked for the first time the Born, the real and the virtual matrix element, the
following file will be generated in the run directory:

sigequiv_hook-btl-XXXX.f
sigequiv_hook-rad-XXXX.f
sigequiv_hook-virt-XXXX.f
sigequiv_hook-born-XXXX.f

The -XXXX label stands for the seed number in case of manyseeds runs. For single runs this label is absent.
Meanwhile, the files

realequivregions-btl-XXXX
realequivregions-rad-XXXX
virtequiv-XXXX
bornequiv-XXXX

contain a (more human readable) list of equivalent configurations.
By inspecting the sigequiv*.f file it should be clear what goes on.

In order to get the hardcoded implementation of equivalent amplitudes the developer should do

cat sigequiv_hook-btl-XXXX.f sigequiv_hook-rad-XXXX.f sigequiv_hook-virt-XXXX.f sigequiv_hook-born-XXXX.f > sigequiv_hook.f

In case of manyseeds, a single seed choice should be made for each file (in some cases of very complex amplitude, the
developer may find different equivalence groups for different seeds, and should choose the best suited one).

The sigequiv_hook.f should be put in any directory that is searched for files to include before the POWHEG-BOX-V2/include
directory. Normally, the compilation directory should work fine.

In the POWHEG-BOX-V2/include directory a default sigequiv_hook.f is present, that forces the equivalent amplitudes to be
searched for at run time. If the developer generated sigequiv_hook.f is present and correctly included in the compilation,
in subsequent runs no *equiv* files will be generated at all.
