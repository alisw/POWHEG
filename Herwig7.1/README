This contains a library that can be loaded in Herwig7.1 in order to shower
POWHEG BOX generated events.

In principle, it is possible to use the standard LesHouches library provided by
ThePEG (see LHE.in in the Herwig7 Contrib directory) to read in .lhe files
generated by POWHEG BOX and to shower them in Herwig. This is not very convenient,
however, due to the following:
a.) The analysis needs to be re-implemented in native Herwig, or other tools
suitable for analyses like Rivet.
b.) The LHE multi-weight standard employed by POWHEG is not compatible with the
one employed by ThePEG. 
c.) The ThePEG library also lacks certain other features (not explained here)
like ub_corr_* factors. 
d.) If Herwig fails to shower the event, it discards it by default, which may
not be desirable. 

In the present, we:
a.) extended the LesHouchesReader in order to allow for POWHEG compatible
multi-weight LHE standard, and to modify the weights of the events (for the
purpose of scalupfac or ub_corr_*)
b.) implemented a HepMC > hepevt converter, that takes the output of Herwig and
converts it into hepevt, which is used to implement many POWHEG BOX analysis;
subsequently it calls the selected analysis on the event
c.) developed a script that generates the Herwig input files, compiles them and
then runs Herwig
d.) prepared and testrun directory with a sample compressed .lhe file (1k
events generated by hvq)

In order to make use of this interface:
a.) you have to copy the whole directory of `Herwig7.1` into the directory with
the process
b.) modify the Makefile in order to select the desired analysis, including its
other dependencies if needed
c.) then simply run make, which will create the `powhegHerwig.so` library
d.) the bash script `testrun/HerwigRun.sh` then generates the corresponding .in
files, including the instructions loading the `powhegHerwig.so` library and
setting up the `powhegLesHouchesReader`, compiles them and runs Herwig
e.) feel free to either modify `testrun/HerwigRun.sh` script or the generated
.in files in order to modify Herwig settings
