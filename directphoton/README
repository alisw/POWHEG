Prerequisites: 
There are two programs required for this powheg process: LHAPDF and LoopTools.
The path to LoopTools needs to be explicitly set in the Makefile.

In order to run the directphoton code, we advise you to use the example directory 'testrun-lhc'.
There is a README.mb and a script to help you with the generation of POWHEG level events (LHEF files).
A second directory 'pythia_example' provides an example on how to apply the Pythia8 parton shower
on the LHEF files.

Big fixes:
- 14/04/2020: the enhancedradfac feature was reported to work only with the old style reweighting 
  (lhrwgt_). It has now been upgraded to work with the rwl_ reweightning (and only with rwl_ 
  reweightning). Previously the sudakov weight due to enhancedradfac was reported as a separate weight. 
  Now the <event> weight is the bare weight of the event and all the weights in the "<rwgt>" block are
  already multiplied by this weight. As a consequence, at least one rwl_ weight must be requested during 
  the `rwl_add 0` stage.
